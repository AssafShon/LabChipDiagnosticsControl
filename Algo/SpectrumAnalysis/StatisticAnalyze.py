        for every waveguide in a chip folder - take the excel results for every waveguide and create one excel file for the chip.
        use AnalyzeSpectrum class for analyzing.

        :param decimation: defines the decimation on the signal at the function smooth spectrum (takes each "decimation" index from the spectrum and then interpulates between the points)
        :param prominence: The prominence of a peak measures how much a peak stands out from the surrounding
                           baseline of the signal and is defined as the vertical distance between the peak and its lowest contour line.:
        :param height: Required height of peaks. Either a number, None, an array matching x or a 2-element squence of thee former.
                       The first element is always interpreted as the minimal and the second, if supplied, as the maximal required height.
        :param distance: Required minimal horizontal distance (>= 1) in samples between neighbouring peaks. Smaller peaks are removed first until the condition is fulfilled for all remaining peaks.
        :param rel_height:Used for calculation of the peaks width, thus it is only used if width is given. See argument rel_height in peak_widths for a full description of its effects.
        :param run_experiment: bool between running an experiment via Analyze spectrum or just analyzing loaded data.
        :param division_width_between_modes:the frequency whoch divides the modes [Thz]
